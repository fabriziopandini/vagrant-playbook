Description: Declarative cluster definition for vagrant, to be used with vagrant-compose plugin.
        
        vagrant-compose is a vagrant plugin, that can be used for creating complex multi-machine scenarios including several set of nodes/virtual machines, each one with different characteristic, software stacks and configuration.
        
        The DSL used by vagrant-compose requires some ruby knowledge, because the Vagrantfile itself is based on ruby, and this fact sometimes is and obstacle for people with limited programming background.
        
        By using vagrant-playbook this issue is mostly addressed because the definition of the cluster is done in yaml, and the ruby programming part within the Vagrantfile is reduced to the minimum.
